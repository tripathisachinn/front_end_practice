// Problem statement 2 Study the code on line 2 in the testing widget carefully. const exampleObject = {collection: [{name: "Kelly",}, {name: "Anna",}],} Your task is to use destructuring to extract and display the name of the second object in the array.


const exampleObject = {collection: [{name: "Kelly",}, {name: "Anna",}],}
const { collection: [, { name: secondObject }] } = exampleObject

console.log(secondObject)


// Problem statement 1
// Given an unsorted array of numbers and another number, you are required to find the index at which the number would be placed if it were to be inserted in a sorted version of the array of numbers.
